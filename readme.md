# PowerPoint Generation POC with Local AI

## 📋 Project Overview

**Status:** ✅ Sprint 1 Complete

Transform your ideas into professional PowerPoint presentations using local AI. No cloud dependency, no API keys - just describe what you need and download your presentation.

## 🎬 See It In Action

**[View Example Output](concept_presentation_created_with_tool.pptx)** - A real PID presentation generated by this tool through natural conversation.

📹 **Demo Video:** *Coming soon*

The AI captured a complete Project Initiation Document including:
- Project overview and problem statement
- Measurable objectives (50% submission increase in 3 months)
- Stakeholder analysis and timeline
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Actionable next steps

*All from a single conversational session - no manual structuring required.*

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Conversation Flow

The AI doesn't just respond - it **actively assesses** your input and decides when enough context exists for a meaningful presentation. Watch the "Create Draft" button light up when the AI determines it has gathered sufficient information about your:
- Project goals and objectives
- Problem statement
- Scope and stakeholders
- Timeline and risks

This isn't a simple keyword check - the AI genuinely evaluates the conversation quality.

### Two Generation Modes

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Quick Mode** | Enter a topic, get a presentation instantly | Simple topics, quick drafts |
| **Guided Mode** | AI assistant conducts a structured interview | Complex projects, PIDs, detailed requirements |

### What Works Now
- 🧠 **AI-Driven Readiness Detection** - The model decides when you've provided enough context
- 🤖 **Structured Draft Generation** - Automatically organizes your ideas into professional slides
- 💬 **Natural Conversation** - Describe your project like you're talking to a colleague
- 📝 **Live Preview** - See your slides before committing to generation
- ⚡ **Real-time Streaming** - Watch AI responses appear as they're generated
- 📥 **Instant PPTX Download** - Professional PowerPoint files ready for use
- 🐳 **Fully Local** - Everything runs on your machine, no cloud required
- 🔒 **Privacy First** - Your ideas never leave your network

### Output Quality
- **Professional Styling** - Blue color scheme, 16:9 widescreen format
- **Dynamic Slide Count** - From quick 3-slide summaries to detailed 20-slide presentations
- **Smart Slide Types** - Title slides, content with bullets, summary with checkmarks
- **Consistent Formatting** - Clean typography, proper spacing, readable bullet points

## 🎯 Project Goals

✅ **Primary Goal:** Demonstrate feasibility of AI-generated PowerPoint presentations
✅ **KISS Approach:** Keep It Simple, Stupid - focus on core functionality first
✅ **Technical Validation:** Prove the concept works with current AI models

## 🚀 Quick Start

**See [QUICK_INSTALL.md](QUICK_INSTALL.md) for full setup instructions.**

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone <repository-url>
cd pptx_poc
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Setup Ollama (skip if you already have one running)
docker compose -f docker-compose.ollama.yml up -d
docker exec ollama ollama pull ministral-3:14b-instruct-2512-q8_0

# 3. Start the stack
docker compose up -d
```

### Project Structure
```

├── docker-compose.yml       # Main stack (connects to external Ollama)
├── docker-compose.ollama.yml # Optional: standalone Ollama for fresh installs
├── .env.example             # Environment template with port/model config
├── QUICK_INSTALL.md         # Setup guide with model recommendations

```

### Key Technologies
- **AI Backend:** Ollama with ministral-3 models (configurable by VRAM)
- **Containerization:** Docker with external network for Ollama sharing
- **Frontend:** nginx:alpine serving vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (port 5102)
- **Orchestrator:** FastAPI with async Ollama integration (port 5100)
- **PPTX Generation:** python-pptx v1.0.0 (port 5101)

## 🎯 Sprint 0: Project Initiation (✅ COMPLETE)

### What We've Accomplished
1. **Project Initiation Document** - Structured PID with clear goals
2. **Requirements Analysis** - Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **User Stories & Use Cases** - Clear user journey mapping
4. **Prioritized Backlog** - Focused on MVP delivery
5. **Conceptual Design** - System architecture overview
6. **Technical Design** - Docker microservices blueprint
7. **Execution Plan** - Step-by-step implementation roadmap
8. **Technology Research** - Evaluated and selected frameworks/libraries

### Key Decisions Made
- **AI Model:** ministral-3-14b-it-2512 (current state-of-the-art as of Dec 2025)
- **Architecture:** Docker microservices with 3-4 containers
- **Frontend:** nginx:alpine + vanilla HTML/JS (no framework)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) - async, same language as PPTX generator
- **PPTX:** python-pptx v1.0.0 - stable, well-maintained
- **LangChain:** Skipped for MVP - direct Ollama HTTP calls sufficient
- **Scope:** 3-slide presentations for MVP
- **Approach:** KISS - minimal complexity, maximum validation

## 🏗️ Sprint 1: Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Components (High Priority)
1. **Frontend Development** - nginx:alpine + vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
2. **Orchestrator Service** - FastAPI with async Ollama integration
3. **PPTX Generator** - python-pptx with basic 3-slide template
4. **Docker Implementation** - Containerize all components

### Phase 2: Integration & Testing
1. **End-to-end workflow validation**
2. **Error handling and edge cases**
3. **Performance optimization**
4. **User acceptance testing**

### Expected Deliverables
- ✅ Working web interface for presentation generation
- ✅ Functional API communication with Ollama backend
- ✅ Professional 3-slide PowerPoint output
- ✅ Downloadable PPTX files
- ✅ Dockerized microservices architecture
